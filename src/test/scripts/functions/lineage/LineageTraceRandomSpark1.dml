# How to invoke this dml script LineageTrace.dml?
# Assume LR_HOME is set to the home of the dml script
# Assume rows = 20 and cols = 20 for X
# hadoop jar SystemDS.jar -f $LR_HOME/LineageTrace.dml -args "$INPUT_DIR/X" "$OUTPUT_DIR/X" "$OUTPUT_DIR/Y"

X = rand(rows=10, cols=3);

X = X * 3;
X = X + 5;

Y = t(X) %*% X;

write(X, $1, format="text");
write(Y, $2, format="text");
