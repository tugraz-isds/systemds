# How to invoke this dml script LineageTrace.dml?
# Assume LR_HOME is set to the home of the dml script
# Assume rows = 20 and cols = 20 for X
# hadoop jar SystemDS.jar -f $LR_HOME/LineageTrace.dml -args "$INPUT_DIR/X" "$OUTPUT_DIR/X" "$OUTPUT_DIR/Y"

X = read($1);
X = X * 3;

ms = matrix(0, rows=2, cols=3*10)
for (v in 1:10, check=0) { # parallelizable
    mv = matrix(v, rows=2, cols=3)
    ms[,(v-1)*3+1:v*3] = mv
}

print(lineage(ms));
write(ms, $2);
