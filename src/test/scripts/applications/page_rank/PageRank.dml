# Assume input and output directories are on hdfs as INPUT_DIR and OUTPUT_DIR
# Assume rows = 1000 and cols = 1000 for g,  rows = 1000 and cols = 1 for p, rows = 1000 and cols = 1 for e, rows = 1 and cols = 1000 for u,
# Assume alpha = 0.85, max_iteration = 3
# hadoop jar SystemDS.jar -f $PAGE_RANK_HOME/PageRank.dml -args "$INPUT_DIR/g" "$INPUT_DIR/p" "$INPUT_DIR/e" "$INPUT_DIR/u" 0.85 3 "$OUPUT_DIR/w"

G = read($1);

p = read($2);
e = read($3);
u = read($4);

	p = alpha * (G %*% p) + (1 - alpha) * (e %*% u %*% p);
	i = i + 1;
