# Implements multinomial naive Bayes classifier with Laplace correction
#
# Example Usage:
# hadoop jar SystemDS.jar -f naive-bayes.dml -nvargs X=<Data> Y=<labels> classes=<Num Classes> laplace=<Laplace Correction> prior=<Model file1> conditionals=<Model file2> accuracy=<accuracy file> fmt="text"
#

# defaults
# $laplace = 1
fmt = ifdef($fmt, "text")

# reading input args
numClasses = $classes
D = read($X)
C = read($Y)
laplace_correction = ifdef($laplace, 1)

numRows = nrow(D)
numFeatures = ncol(D)

# Compute conditionals

# Compute the feature counts for each class
classFeatureCounts = matrix(0, rows=numClasses, cols=numFeatures)
parfor (i in 1:numFeatures) {
  Col = D[,i]
  classFeatureCounts[,i] = aggregate(target=Col, groups=C, fn="sum", ngroups=as.integer(numClasses))
}

# Compute the total feature count for each class 
# and add the number of features to this sum
# for subsequent regularization (Laplace's rule)
classSums = rowSums(classFeatureCounts) + numFeatures*laplace_correction

# Compute class conditional probabilities
ones = matrix(1, rows=1, cols=numFeatures)
repClassSums = classSums %*% ones
class_conditionals = (classFeatureCounts + laplace_correction) / repClassSums

# Compute class priors
class_counts = aggregate(target=C, groups=C, fn="count", ngroups=as.integer(numClasses))
class_prior = class_counts / numRows;

# Compute accuracy on training set
ones = matrix(1, rows=numRows, cols=1)
D_w_ones = cbind(D, ones)
model = cbind(class_conditionals, class_prior)
log_probs = D_w_ones %*% t(log(model))
pred = rowIndexMax(log_probs)
acc = sum(pred == C) / numRows * 100

acc_str = "Training Accuracy (%): " + acc
print(acc_str)
write(acc_str, $accuracy)

# write out the model
write(class_prior, $prior, format=fmt);
write(class_conditionals, $conditionals, format=fmt);
