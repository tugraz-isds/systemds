# Implements multinomial naive Bayes classifier with Laplace correction
#
# Example Usage:
# hadoop jar SystemDS.jar -f naive-bayes.dml -nvargs X=<Data> Y=<labels> classes=<Num Classes> laplace=<Laplace Correction> prior=<Model file1> conditionals=<Model file2> accuracy=<accuracy file> fmt="text"
#

# defaults
# $laplace = 1
fmt = ifdef($fmt, "text")

# reading input args
numClasses = $classes
D = read($X)
C = read($Y)
laplaceCorrection = ifdef($laplace, 1)

numRows = nrow(D)
numFeatures = ncol(D)

# Compute conditionals
# Compute the feature counts for each class
classFeatureCounts = aggregate(target=D, groups=C, fn="sum", ngroups=as.integer(numClasses));

# Compute the total feature count for each class 
# and add the number of features to this sum
# for subsequent regularization (Laplace's rule)
classSums = rowSums(classFeatureCounts) + numFeatures*laplaceCorrection

# Compute class conditional probabilities
classConditionals = (classFeatureCounts + laplaceCorrection) / classSums

# Compute class priors
classCounts = aggregate(target=C, groups=C, fn="count", ngroups=as.integer(numClasses))
classPrior = classCounts / numRows;

# Compute accuracy on training set
logProbs = D %*% t(log(classConditionals)) + t(log(classPrior));
acc = sum(rowIndexMax(logProbs) == C) / numRows * 100

acc_str = "Training Accuracy (%): " + acc
print(acc_str)
write(acc_str, $accuracy)

# write out the model
write(classPrior, $prior, format=fmt);
write(classConditionals, $conditionals, format=fmt);
