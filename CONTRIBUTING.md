# Contributing to SystemDS

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to SystemDS!

The following are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code Style

Before contributing a pull request, we highly suggest applying a code formatter to the written code.

We have provided at profile for java located in [Codestyle File ./docs/CodeStyle.eclipse.xml](./docs/CodeStyle_eclipse.xml). This can be loaded in most editors e.g.:

- [Eclipse](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10432538/eclipse-import-conf-xml-files#10433986)
- [IntelliJ](https://imagej.net/Eclipse_code_style_profiles_and_IntelliJ)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46030629/need-to-import-eclipse-java-formatter-profile-in-visual-studio-code)

## License

Each file in the project has a header license, when adding files remember to add an appropriate comment for that filetype containing the license. One Example is this file: [RAW Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tugraz-isds/systemds/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The specific type of commenting `\** *\` or `# ...` varies depending on filetype, but the content is the same except for year and "Modifications".
A rule of thumb is that the License should be updated if more than 5 lines of code changed in the file. The following it the two types of license headers:

License header for new Files:
